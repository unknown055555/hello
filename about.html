                    <h3>When was BIT Sindri founded ?</h3>

Consequently, BIT Sindri was brought into the world by a principal, three professors, and sixty undergraduates in a simple function with some tea over the dining table. The Institute developed and prospered quickly during the good 'ole days under the dynamic leadership of Prof. D.L. Deshpande, the then Director[1950-61], who is considered "The architect of the Institute."

Later, it became the affiliated engineering college of Vinoba Bhave University, Hazaribagh. Currently, it is under the affiliation of the Jharkhand University of Technology, Ranchi. Hence, the degree is honored by the JUT.
